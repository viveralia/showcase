[Showcase](https://sleepy-boyd-6f9c5e.netlify.com/) is an app to build amazing portfolios with a couple of clicks. Why bothering downloading your assets from Instagram and copying your experience and education from LinkedIn when you can let JavaScript handle that request. Ba dum tss! ü•Å

## How does it work?
Showcase will only ask a few usernames when signing up and will scrap your data from the web (Instagram and LinkedIn) using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) requests from the server and parsing the data with [cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/). The app also includes an array of user agents to mimic different browsers on each request and by making it more difficult for the scraped page to detect the bot.

## Technologies and requirements
In order to run the app locally you should be familiar with the MERN stack:
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node JS

Some of the technologies that were used to buid this project are:
- Styled-components
- Axios for requests
- Cheerio for scraping
- React Helmet for the SEO
- React Router
- Sweet Alert for handling the system status
- Typed.js for the typing effect on the homepage
- Passport for handling the sessions and the users

among others...

### Test it out!
In order to test the app, you can use the following credentials:
- email: morlancordero@gmail.com
- password: 123

You can update the name, headline, about and change the theme color (more customizable options in future versions).

## What's next?
The idea can be replicated not only for designers or photographers, but also small and medium size businesses by crawling or getting the API from Google My Business, Facebook Pages, Dribble, Behance, and many more.
